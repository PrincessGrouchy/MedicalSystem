# MedicalSystem
Front end for a unified medical system

The project proposed aims to provide easy management and access to usersâ€™ health care. 
This is accomplished through designing and implementing an access system for use by both 
patients and healthcare workers.  This is based off of the AHS app currently available 
to the public. The project will provide patients and healthcare workers with easy access
to patient records, and will facilitate appointment bookings.
